# learning-web-dev
A repo to keep track of all my builds (well, mostly trash) throughout my journey of mastering web development.

**[Index Page](https://swaroopsrp.github.io/learning-web-dev/index.html)**

## NOTE!
All the JavaScript codebase and tracking would be in separate repository. This repo only holds the HTML + CSS content as well as micro-projects I create (incl. using JS). All the projects shall be indexed here though.
